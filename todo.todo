Portfolio Tasks:
    Socials & Visuals:
        [] Import proper icons for social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Medium)
        [] Update “Talk to Me (AI)” button — try different icon, improve highlight effect
        [] Swap website picture and update logos/meta data
        [] Improve navbar styling + spacing (desktop & mobile)

    Chatbot/AI Features:
        [] Refine AI chatbot UI — should cover more of the page, fix mobile layout
        [] Build actual chatbot functionality (basic Q&A to start)
        [] Write a custom AI prompt with my writing style + guardrails for focused answers (only Jeevi-related questions/info)
        [] Add proxy, stronger prompting, and limits to avoid high AI token usage

    Backend/Endpoint:
        [] Implement “Contact Me” functionality (email form, serverless function, etc.)

        [] Consider reusing previous backend — general-purpose backend on Render with multiple endpoints

        - Remove location and highlights
        - Expand “System Stats” with fun facts

        [] Fix Featured Projects section:
        - Consider reusing old project section (updated theme)
        - Add links to demos or YouTube videos
        [] Update Work Experience content
        [] Import old tech stack from previous portfolio — match new theme & styling
